# Vercel Deployment

## How to Deploy

1. Push your code to GitHub (or connect your repo to Vercel).
2. Vercel will auto-detect the frontend (Vite) and backend (Express in `server/index.js`).
3. The `vercel.json` config is already set up for static frontend and API routes.

## Environment Variables

- Set your MongoDB URI and any secrets in Vercel Project Settings > Environment Variables.
- Example: `MONGODB_URI`, `NODE_ENV`, etc.

## File Uploads

- **Warning:** File uploads are NOT persistent on Vercel serverless functions. Uploaded files will not be saved. Use a cloud storage service (S3, etc.) for production uploads.

## Build & Output

- Vercel will run `vite build` and serve the output from `/dist`.
- API routes are handled by Express in `server/index.js`.

## Local Development

- Run `npm run dev` for frontend.
- Run `npm run server` for backend (local only).
